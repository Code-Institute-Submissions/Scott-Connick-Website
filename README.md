# Scott Connick - Tattoo Artist - Personal Website

## Project One: User Centric Frontend Developemt

This is a static, frontend-only website, to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills.

The website is a personal page, for a professional tattoo artist. The aim of the site is to engage users by showcasing the artist's work, and provide contact details for any prospective clients to engage with the artist.

The website will be a single scrolling page, as I believe this is optimum for mobile-first design, which is how I believe the most traffic will view the website. There will be separate page areas for separate parts of the website.

### Demo

A live demo of the website can be found here: https://sarahcrosby.github.io/Scott-Connick-Website/

### Technologies and Languages
* [Bootstrap (4.1.3)](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for the template, and to build a responsive and visually appealing site.
* [Javascript (1.8.5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - the language and logic of the interactive elements on the page
* [jQuery(3.3)](https://jquery.com/) - a JavaScript library to enhance the user's experience
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - the language used to customise and present the web app.
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - the language used to write and create the web app.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - for version control, and to host the project.
* [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) - the cloud-based integrated development environment used to write the code.

### UX

I will use a Bootstrap template, which will make the website as responsive and visually-appealing as possible. I will maintain a clear distinction between my code and the Bootstrap code, by including a library with the original Bootstrap code. I will demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills by adding custom elements and styles to the template.

I chose this particular template because it is a single scrolling page, and I believe it is well tailored for the creative industry. The website source can be found here: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/

I also wanted to implement the following user stories:
